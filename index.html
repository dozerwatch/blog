                    <p class="entry">A significant amount of notes were taken for CSE466 and CSE365 lectures. I should be all caught up by tomorrow. Around 2 hours were spent on OTW: Bandit; I got from level 0 to (23 ---> 24). Majority of the time was spent on this last level. Time was spent on Bandit because pwn.college was down due to deadlines. Race conditions lectures were finished today and notes will be logged tomorrow. Challenges were started and finished up to level 2.1.</p>
                    <p class="entry">Following the CSE365 course might be a bad idea because it will become a distraction and a waste of time. Time is better spent working on new material and trying to catch up to CSE598. Hence CSE365 notes should be stopped. The same can be said for Bandit. Although, it was fun and challenging towards the end, it should be used only when pwn.college is down. Bandit should not be pursued further.</p>
                    <p class="entry">All focus should be spent on CSE466.</p>
