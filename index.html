        <p>Why does subprocess.Popen.communicate() work in ipython but fails in a python script?</p>

        <p>I learned how to use pipes in C, redirecting the stdout of a program into the stdin of another. This process requires fork(), execve(), pipe(), and dup2(). There is still some confusion on how this works exactly.</p>

        <p>I worked on Program Interaction. The levels I had difficulty with are 48 and 52. I wasn't able to complete level 48 using pwntools, but was successful with the subprocess module. I will have to go back and find out why.</p>

        <p>On level 52, I had difficulty understanding pipes and still do. If I spawn a cat process and PIPE its stdout, the process will not exit with ctrl+d, ctrl+c, or ctrl+z. I have to PIPE its stdin, too! Then I use the communicate() method to well ... communicate (to its stdin). </p>

        <p>Today shows that I still have lots to learn about linux pipes and how to use it to interact with other processes and pwntools.</p>

        <p>I worked on Program Interaction, level 1 to 31. These are some things that I learned.</p>

        <ul> 
            <li>File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.</li> 
            <li>The <i>argv</i> argument in <i>execve</i> must end with <i>NULL</i>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I finished on Program Misuse. Most levels were simple as GTFOBins had the exploits. </p>
        <p>I learned that .so (shared output) files are linked during runtime. So if you change anything in a .so file, you don't need to recompile the main program.</p>
