                    <p class="entry">I wanted to play the Urmia CTF because I thought it would be easy. I ended being stuck on "look-up" for hours. It was a challenge that I have done numerous times on pwn.college, but it still took me hours. After I finished it, I wanted to try the other pwn challenge "orange". I also spent hours on this one, but I couldn't get the flag. It was 2AM when I started. When I looked at the clock after deciding to throw in the towel for "orange", it was 8AM. Out of fustration for not being able to get the flag, I blew through some heap challenges on PicoCTF. Still unsatisfied, I tried level 8 of kernel security and completed it. Now it's 10AM. What am I doing?</p>
                    <p class="entry">I said on Wednesday, not even 4 days ago, that I wouldn't do this. Wait... I just realised I made a typo and say "Lets do that again". Hahaha! Well I stayed true to my word, then.</p>
                    <p class="entry">But seriously, let's NOT do that again. And no typo this time.</p>

I solved these levels with kernel shellcode that escalate privileges and reading and chmoding the flag, respectively.

                    <p class="entry">As for the other things... I watch and took notes on Rob's latest lecture on reverse engineering. I took on some reversing and pwn challenges on the CSAW CTF: baby rev, magic tricks, diving into null, and mini golfing. I wasn't able to complete the pwn challenges, and quite excited to look up some writeups when they come out.</p>

Around 2 hours were spent on OTW: Bandit; I got from level 0 to (23 ---> 24). Majority of the time was spent on this last level. Time was spent on Bandit because pwn.college was down due to deadlines. Race conditions lectures were finished today and notes will be logged tomorrow. Challenges were started and finished up to level 2.1.</p>

Time is better spent working on new material and trying to catch up to CSE598. Hence CSE365 notes should be stopped. The same can be said for Bandit. Although, it was fun and challenging towards the end, it should be used only when pwn.college is down. Bandit should not be pursued further.</p>
