The lectures were on some really simple stuff, so I don't think I am missing out on too much. As for CSE466, I finished up to Rob's office hour. A new lecture dropped today and I will watch it tomorrow.</p>
                    <p class="entry">I helped some people on the discord today and find that this is actually a really good way to review material and get an even better understanding. By helping others, I am helping myself. A win win. I will definitely continue doing so and maybe even more so.</p>
                    <p class="entry">I ended up finishing race conditions "today" at 9AM. What is wrong with me.... This module is super interesting and kind of easy which is makes it so addicting. And I reallllly want that green belt.</p>

I was finally able to figure out the chmod solution, though it took, maybe, too much time for what it was worth. The race conditions levels 3 and 4 were pretty simple, but 5 took me a long time. I definitely learned a lot about renameat2(), though. The concept of race conditions is still foggy to me and I will need to study it further.</p>

                    <p class="entry">A significant amount of notes were taken for CSE466 and CSE365 lectures. I should be all caught up by tomorrow. Around 2 hours were spent on OTW: Bandit; I got from level 0 to (23 ---> 24). Majority of the time was spent on this last level. Time was spent on Bandit because pwn.college was down due to deadlines. Race conditions lectures were finished today and notes will be logged tomorrow. Challenges were started and finished up to level 2.1.</p>
                    <p class="entry">Following the CSE365 course might be a bad idea because it will become a distraction and a waste of time. Time is better spent working on new material and trying to catch up to CSE598. Hence CSE365 notes should be stopped. The same can be said for Bandit. Although, it was fun and challenging towards the end, it should be used only when pwn.college is down. Bandit should not be pursued further.</p>
                    <p class="entry">All focus should be spent on CSE466.</p>
